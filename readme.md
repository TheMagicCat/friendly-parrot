# Friendly Parrot

A weird, minimal framework for pipelining functions in a kind-of FP way. Modified to include an `ap` function, and accept Promises which resolve to functions.

A work in progress!

Basically ported from the [Async Problem](https://github.com/plaid/async-problem/blob/master/promises-pipe.js) and @dtipson's gist [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dtipson/d6e369b3a16ed939e5b6/raw/e628dba9a4e6204ef97683169c636aae318b4e5c/compose.curry.mapWith.js)
